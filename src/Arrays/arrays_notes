                                        ARRAYS
An array is collection of similar types of data having contingous memory allocation.
        Java has no concept of pointers.

        --> Indexing of arrays starts from zero i.e. first element will be stored at zeroth index, second
        element at first index, third element at second index and so on.

--> The size of an array cannot be increased at runtime, therefore we can store only a fixed size
       of element in arrays.

       ACCESSING ARRAY ELEMENTS:
       -->Arrays are immutable i.e. you cannot change the size of the array.
       -->Data cannot be altered individually.

       USE CASE : --> Storing marks of 5 students.
       int [] Marks = New int[5]

      1. int [] Marks --> Declaration
            int --> type of data that will be stored in array
            Marks --> Reference
            new --> object
            int[5] --> data type
        Marks = New int[5]   --> Memory Allocation

      2. int [] Marks = New int[5] -->  Declaration + Memory Allocation

      3. int [] Marks = {1,2,3,4,5..} -->Declaration
                                      -->Memory Allocation
                                      -->Initialization


        --> Size of array = number of enteries
        -->By default the size of array will be equal to the number of entries given as input.

        function --> block of code that contain algorithm expression.

        -->Arrays cannot be printed directly, because it encodes value.
        -->Arrays can be printed using loops.
