Sometimes our programs grow in size and we wish to keep our logic clean by not mentioning the code in our main function,
in this case we use methods.

-->A method is a function written inside a class. Since Java is an Object Oriented Language or OOP we need
    to write method inside class.

--> Method and function are used interchangeably in industries.

-->Arguments are real.
-->Parameters are variable.

* Calling a method
-->Instance of class is called as object.
-->A method can be called by creating an object of class in which the method exists folllowed by
    method call.

* Method Overloading
-->In Java a class can have same method name with different parameters.
Readablity of program -->

#Note :
Method overloading cannot be performed by changing the user type of method.

* For a method to get overloaded.
1. Function name should be same.
2. Return type should be same.
3. Parameters should be different.

* Ways of Method Overloading :
1. By changing the return type.
2. In this we have create a class calculate.
3. In the class calculate we have two methods with the same name multipy.
4. The two methods are overloaded because they have the same name but return type is different.
5. The return type of the first method is int while the return type of other method is double.
